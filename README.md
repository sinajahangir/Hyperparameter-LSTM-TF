# Hyperparameter-LSTM-TF
Repository accessed by Colab for developing DL models, specifically LSTMs. Bayesian optimization is utilized for rigorous hyperparameter optimization

The repo contains a sample Google Colab Notebook and data associated with the paper (Jahangir et al., 2023): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169423002111

The code had to be modified to resolve TF and other dependency updates
